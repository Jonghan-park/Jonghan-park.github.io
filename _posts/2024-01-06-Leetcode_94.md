Given an array of strings words, return the first palindromic string in the array. If there is no such string, return an empty string "".

A string is palindromic if it reads the same forward and backward.

Example 1:

Input: words = ["abc","car","ada","racecar","cool"]
Output: "ada"
Explanation: The first string that is palindromic is "ada".
Note that "racecar" is also palindromic, but it is not the first.
Example 2:

Input: words = ["notapalindrome","racecar"]
Output: "racecar"
Explanation: The first and only string that is palindromic is "racecar".
Example 3:

Input: words = ["def","ghi"]
Output: ""
Explanation: There are no palindromic strings, so the empty string is returned.

Constraints:

1 <= words.length <= 100
1 <= words[i].length <= 100
words[i] consists only of lowercase English letters.

```js
/**
 * @param {string[]} words
 * @return {string}
 */
var firstPalindrome = function (words) {
  // Iterate through each word in the array
  for (let i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
    // reversedWord = words[i].split("").reverse().join("");

    // Split the current word into an array of characters
    let wordArr = words[i].split("");

    // Initialize two pointers for reversing the characters in the word
    let left = 0;
    let right = wordArr.length - 1;

    // Use a while loop to reverse the characters in the current word
    while (left < right) {
      // Swap characters at 'left' and 'right' positions using a temporary variable
      let temp = wordArr[left];
      wordArr[left] = wordArr[right];
      wordArr[right] = temp;

      // Increment 'left' and decrement 'right' pointers
      left++;
      right--;
    }

    // if (words[i] == reversedWord) {

    // Join the reversed characters back into a word
    // Check if the reversed word is equal to the original word
    if (words[i] == wordArr.join("")) {
      // Return the word if it is a palindrome
      return words[i];
    }
  }
  // Return an empty string if no palindrome is found
  return "";
};
```

Time Complexity:

The time complexity of the code is O(n \* m), where n is the number of words in the array (words), and m is the maximum length of any word in the array.

Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(n), where n is the maximum length of any word in the array. The additional space is used to store the character array (wordArr) for each word.
