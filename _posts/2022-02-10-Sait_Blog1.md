**React** is a UI _JavaScript library_ that focuses on creating a UI (User Interface) for single-page applications. React uses a simple grammar called **JavaScript XML (JSX)** that contains HTML in JavaScript and one-way data binding, and it is a library that uses the concept of Virtual DOM to optimize the performance of web applications. 

**React** is a JavaScript library that creates UI in single-page applications, so it is insufficient compared to other frameworks that create single-page applications. React, for example, does not provide page switching, so if you need to switch pages using React, you need to use additional libraries such as **react-router.**
