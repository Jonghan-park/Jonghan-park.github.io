**React** is a free and open-source front-end _JavaScript library_ that focuses on creating a UI (User Interface) for single-page applications. React is for **Web** and **Mobile** and not *Framework* like Angular and Blazor, and React is not MVC design pattern. React uses a simple grammar called **JavaScript XML (JSX)** that contains HTML in JavaScript and one-way data binding, and it is a library that uses the concept of Virtual DOM to optimize the performance of web applications. React lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.

As I said, **React** is a JavaScript library that creates UI in single-page applications, so it is insufficient compared to other frameworks that create single-page applications. React, for example, does not provide page switching, so if you need to switch pages using React, you need to use additional libraries such as **react-router.**
