You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and stones representing the stones you have. Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

Example 1:

Input: jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: jewels = "z", stones = "ZZ"
Output: 0

```js
/**
 * @param {string} jewels
 * @param {string} stones
 * @return {number}
 */
var numJewelsInStones = function (jewels, stones) {
  let jewelsArr = jewels.split("");
  let count = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < jewelsArr.length; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < stones.length; j++) {
      if (jewelsArr[i] === stones.charAt(j)) {
        count++;
      }
    }
  }
  return count;
};
```

`let jewelsArr = jewels.split("");`: Convert the `jewels` string into an array `jewelsArr`, where each element represents a single character from the `jewels` string.

`let count = 0;`: Initialize a variable `count` to 0. This variable will store the number of jewels found in the `stones` string.

`for (let i = 0; i < jewelsArr.length; i++) {`: Start a loop that iterates over each character in the `jewelsArr`.

`for (let j = 0; j < stones.length; j++) {`: Start an inner loop that iterates over each character in the `stones` string.

`if (jewelsArr[i] === stones.charAt(j)) {`: Check if the character at index `i` in `jewelsArr` is equal to the character at index `j` in `stones`.

`count++;`: If the characters match, increment the `count` variable.

`return count;`: Return the final count of jewels found in the `stones` string after the loops finish.
