I can use Bootstrap which allow front-end features easily while I'm building a react app. Open the terminal and type a below code.
```
$ npm install bootstrap
```

After that, I can use bootstrap simply putting a below code in the index.js of the project.
```
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css';
```

Now, I can use the bootstrap with react.
