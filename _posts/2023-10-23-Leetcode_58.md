You are given a 0-indexed, strictly increasing integer array nums and a positive integer diff. A triplet (i, j, k) is an arithmetic triplet if the following conditions are met:

i < j < k,
nums[j] - nums[i] == diff, and
nums[k] - nums[j] == diff.
Return the number of unique arithmetic triplets.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [0,1,4,6,7,10], diff = 3
Output: 2
Explanation:
(1, 2, 4) is an arithmetic triplet because both 7 - 4 == 3 and 4 - 1 == 3.
(2, 4, 5) is an arithmetic triplet because both 10 - 7 == 3 and 7 - 4 == 3. 
Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,8,9], diff = 2
Output: 2
Explanation:
(0, 2, 4) is an arithmetic triplet because both 8 - 6 == 2 and 6 - 4 == 2.
(1, 3, 5) is an arithmetic triplet because both 9 - 7 == 2 and 7 - 5 == 2.


```js
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @param {number} diff
 * @return {number}
 */
var arithmeticTriplets = function(nums, diff) {
    // Create a map to store elements from the nums array.
    let map = new Map()
    // Initialize a count variable with the value 0.
    let count = 0;

    // Iterate trough nums array using a for loop
    for(let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++){
        // For each element nums[i], check if map contains two elements: one where the current element is reduced by the 'diff' value and another where the current element is reduced by 'diff' value twice.
        if(map.has(nums[i] - diff) && map.has(nums[i] - diff - diff)){
            // If so, increment count value.
            count++
        }
        // Set the current element in map
        map.set(nums[i])
    }
    // return count
    return count;
};

```

You start by initializing an empty `Map` called `map` to store elements from the `nums` array.

The variable `count` is initialized to 0. This variable will be used to keep track of the count of triplets that satisfy the condition.

You iterate through the `nums` array using a `for` loop.

For each element `nums[i]`, you check if `map` contains two elements: `nums[i] - diff` and `nums[i] - diff - diff`. In other words, you are looking for two previous elements in the array such that the difference between the current element and those two previous elements is equal to `diff`.

If both conditions are met, you increment the `count` by 1, indicating that you've found a triplet that satisfies the condition.

After checking the conditions, you add the current element `nums[i]` to the `map` using `map.set(nums[i])`. This step ensures that you have a record of the current element in the map for future iterations.

The loop continues to the next element in the `nums` array, and the process repeats.

Finally, you return the `count`, which represents the total number of triplets in the `nums` array that satisfy the condition.

The time complexity of the code is O(n), where n is the length of the nums array. The primary loop iterates through each element in the nums array exactly once.
