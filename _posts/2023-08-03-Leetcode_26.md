Given a valid (IPv4) IP address, return a defanged version of that IP address.

A defanged IP address replaces every period "." with "[.]".

Example 1:

Input: address = "1.1.1.1"
Output: "1[.]1[.]1[.]1"
Example 2:

Input: address = "255.100.50.0"
Output: "255[.]100[.]50[.]0"

```js
/**
 * @param {string} address
 * @return {string}
 */
var defangIPaddr = function (address) {
  return address.split(".").join("[.]");
};
```

`var defangIPaddr = function(address) { ... }`: This line declares a variable `defangIPaddr` and assigns it an anonymous function. The function takes a single parameter `address`, which is expected to be a string.

`return address.split(".").join("[.]")`: Inside the function, the input `address` is processed. The `split(".")` method is used to split the string at every occurrence of a period (dot), resulting in an array of substrings.

`.join("[.]")`: The `join()` method is then used on the array of substrings to concatenate them back into a string, where each element of the array is separated by the string "[.]" instead of the original periods.
