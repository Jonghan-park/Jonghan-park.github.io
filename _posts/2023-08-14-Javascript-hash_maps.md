## Hash maps

A hash map is a data structure that stores key-value pairs and provides efficient access and retrieval of values based on their associated keys. It is also known as an object or dictionary in JavaScript. Hash maps are commonly used for organizing and managing data in a way that allows fast lookups and updates.

In a hash map:

`Keys`: Keys are unique identifiers used to access the corresponding values. They can be of any data type that can be hashed, such as strings or numbers.

`Values`: Values are the actual data associated with the keys. They can be of any data type, including numbers, strings, objects, functions, and even other hash maps.
