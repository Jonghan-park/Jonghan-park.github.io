You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively.

Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.

The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1. To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.

Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1,2,3] and [2,5,6].
The result of the merge is [1,2,2,3,5,6] with the underlined elements coming from nums1.
Example 2:

Input: nums1 = [1], m = 1, nums2 = [], n = 0
Output: [1]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1] and [].
The result of the merge is [1].
Example 3:

Input: nums1 = [0], m = 0, nums2 = [1], n = 1
Output: [1]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [] and [1].
The result of the merge is [1].
Note that because m = 0, there are no elements in nums1. The 0 is only there to ensure the merge result can fit in nums1.

```js
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums1
 * @param {number} m
 * @param {number[]} nums2
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {void} Do not return anything, modify nums1 in-place instead.
 */
var merge = function (nums1, m, nums2, n) {
  // Initialize pointers for the merged array (nums1)
  let i = m - 1; // Pointer for the last element in nums1
  let j = n - 1; // Pointer for the last element in nums2
  let k = m + n - 1; // Pointer for the last position in the merged array (nums1)

  // Iterate through nums2 from the end to the beginning
  while (j >= 0) {
    // If there are elements remaining in nums1 and the current element in nums1 is greater
    if (i >= 0 && nums1[i] > nums2[j]) {
      // Copy the greater element from nums1 to the end of the merged array
      nums1[k--] = nums1[i--];
    } else {
      // Copy the current element from nums2 to the end of the merged array
      nums1[k--] = nums2[j--];
    }
  }
};
```

Starting from the end of each array, the algorithm compares elements and places them in descending order in `nums1`. The while loop iterates through `nums2`, and the time complexity is O(m + n), where m and n are the lengths of `nums1` and `nums2`, respectively. The algorithm efficiently combines the arrays by avoiding the need for additional space and achieving a linear time complexity relative to the total number of elements in the input arrays.
