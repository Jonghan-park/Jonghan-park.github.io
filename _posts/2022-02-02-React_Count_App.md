This is the project using react I want to learn. The purpose of the project is getting familiar with react and learning how to use react features on the project.

I've learned the project from YouTube.
 [React begginner YouTube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke90Tje7VS0&t=1259s)

Make components folder underneath src.
And then, make a file named counter.jsx
