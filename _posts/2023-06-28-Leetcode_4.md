## Fizz Buzz

Given an integer n, return a string array answer (1-indexed) where:

answer[i] == "FizzBuzz" if i is divisible by 3 and 5.
answer[i] == "Fizz" if i is divisible by 3.
answer[i] == "Buzz" if i is divisible by 5.
answer[i] == i (as a string) if none of the above conditions are true.

Example 1:

Input: n = 3
Output: ["1","2","Fizz"]
Example 2:

Input: n = 5
Output: ["1","2","Fizz","4","Buzz"]
Example 3:

Input: n = 15
Output: ["1","2","Fizz","4","Buzz","Fizz","7","8","Fizz","Buzz","11","Fizz","13","14","FizzBuzz"]

```js
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {string[]}
 */
var fizzBuzz = function (n) {
  let answers = [];

  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    let by3 = i % 3 === 0;
    let by5 = i % 5 === 0;
    if (by3 && by5) {
      answers.push("FizzBuzz");
    } else if (by5) {
      answers.push("Buzz");
    } else if (by3) {
      answers.push("Fizz");
    } else {
      answers.push(i.toString());
    }
  }
  return answers;
};
```

The function fizzBuzz takes the input 'n' which is number. `answers` array is empty and initialized at first which will store the results strings. A for loop used to interate from 1 to 'n'. Inside the loop, two Boolean variables are declared: `by3` and `by5` These variables store the result of checking if the current number i is divisible by 3 and 5, respectively.

Time complexity : O(n)
Space complexity : O(n)
