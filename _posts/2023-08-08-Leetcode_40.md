Given the array nums, for each nums[i] find out how many numbers in the array are smaller than it. That is, for each nums[i] you have to count the number of valid j's such that j != i and nums[j] < nums[i].

Return the answer in an array.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [8,1,2,2,3]
Output: [4,0,1,1,3]
Explanation:
For nums[0]=8 there exist four smaller numbers than it (1, 2, 2 and 3).
For nums[1]=1 does not exist any smaller number than it.
For nums[2]=2 there exist one smaller number than it (1).
For nums[3]=2 there exist one smaller number than it (1).
For nums[4]=3 there exist three smaller numbers than it (1, 2 and 2).
Example 2:

Input: nums = [6,5,4,8]
Output: [2,1,0,3]
Example 3:

Input: nums = [7,7,7,7]
Output: [0,0,0,0]

```js
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var smallerNumbersThanCurrent = function (nums) {
  let result = [];
  let count = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < nums.length; j++) {
      if (nums[i] > nums[j]) {
        count++;
      }
    }
    result.push(count);
    count = 0;
  }
  return result;
};
```

`let result = []`: Initialize an empty array `result` to store the count of smaller numbers for each element in the `nums` array.

`let count = 0;`: Initialize a variable count to 0. This variable will keep track of the count of smaller numbers for the current element.

`for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {`: Start a loop that iterates over each element in the `nums` array.

`for (let j = 0; j < nums.length; j++) {`: Start an inner loop that iterates over each element in the `nums` array again.

`if (nums[i] > nums[j]) {`: Check if the current element at index `i` is greater than the element at index `j`.

`count++`: If the condition is true, increment the `count` variable.

`result.push(count)`: Push the final count of smaller numbers for the current element onto the result array.

`count = 0`: Reset the `count` variable to 0 for the next iteration.

`return result`: Return the `result` array containing the counts of smaller numbers for each element.
