A decimal number is called deci-binary if each of its digits is either 0 or 1 without any leading zeros. For example, 101 and 1100 are deci-binary, while 112 and 3001 are not.

Given a string n that represents a positive decimal integer, return the minimum number of positive deci-binary numbers needed so that they sum up to n.

Example 1:

Input: n = "32"
Output: 3
Explanation: 10 + 11 + 11 = 32
Example 2:

Input: n = "82734"
Output: 8
Example 3:

Input: n = "27346209830709182346"
Output: 9

Constraints:

1 <= n.length <= 105
n consists of only digits.
n does not contain any leading zeros and represents a positive integer.

```js
/**
 * @param {string} n
 * @return {number}
 */
var minPartitions = function (n) {
  // Use the spread operator (...) to pass the elements of the array as individual arguments to the Math.max function.
  // Math.max is a built-in function that returns the largest of zero or more numbers.
  return Math.max(...n);
};
```

The time complexity of Math.max is generally considered to be O(n), where n is the number of arguments passed.
The space complexity of this function is O(n) because the spread operator creates a new array of length n.
