Given an integer array nums, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2
Output: [3,99,-1,-100]
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]

```js
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @param {number} k
 * @return {void} Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
 */
var rotate = function (nums, k) {
  // Calculate the remainder of k divided by the length of the array (To handle cases where k is larger than the array length)
  k %= nums.length;

  // Remove the last k elements from the array and store them in a new array called removed
  // nums = [1,2,3,4]
  // removed = [5,6,7]
  const removed = nums.splice(-k);
  // Add the removed elements to the beginning of the nums array
  // removed + nums
  nums.unshift(...removed);
};
```

The time complexity of the rotate function is O(n), where n is the length of the input array nums. This is because the function performs a linear scan of the array to shift the elements by k positions to the right.
