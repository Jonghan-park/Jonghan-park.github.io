# Outline  
The purpose of this posting is to create a React project and take a look at what features React have. Beside, I'm going to upload the video for demonstration of using React which helps readers understand React.

# What projects am I going to demonstrate in React?  
I'm going to make two projects to demonstrate React functions and try to focus on basic function to be familiar with React.  

1. Fruit basket  (UseState)
  This is the project using useState and functional components, and the basic concept for this project is displaying what kinds of fruit and how many fruits in each basket in the data file which consists of array. If the fruits increased more and more, the fruits will be displayed on the form. For this function, useState will be using for implementation.

2. News Using api (useEffect and Conditional Rendering)

# First Project: Fruit basket   
I'm going to demonstrate how we can use React function with my simple project. It's quite the simple application, but it has the basic function we have to know about React, so

This is the screenshot of complete application. Let's make it together. 
   
First step for this project is create the application using create-react-app command.   

I'm going to create a react application named react-fruit-basket. If you don't know how to do it, you'd probably better go back to blog1 I posted a month ago and try to make hello-react application.

```js
import React, { useState } from 'react';
```   
The above code is on the top of the app.js which means loads a useState function from a react package. The useState is also kind of hook which makes it possible to take a React function component and add state to it.
