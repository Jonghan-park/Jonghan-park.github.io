# What projects am I going to demonstrate in React?  
I'm going to make two projects to demonstrate React functions and try to focus on basic function to be familiar with React. 
1. Fruit basket  (UseState)
  This is the project using UseState and functional components. 
2. News Using api (useEffect and Conditional Rendering)

# First Project. Fruit basket   
I'm going to demonstrate how we can use React function with my simple project. It's quite the simple application.   
<img src="/assets/app_fruit.png" alt="fruit" width="600"/>   
This is the screenshot of complete application. Let's make it together. 
  
I'm going to create a folder for the project named Unit converter and React project in the folder named react-unit-converter.
