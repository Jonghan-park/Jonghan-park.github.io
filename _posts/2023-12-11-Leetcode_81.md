You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums and an integer k. Your task is to perform the following operation exactly k times in order to maximize your score:

Select an element m from nums.
Remove the selected element m from the array.
Add a new element with a value of m + 1 to the array.
Increase your score by m.
Return the maximum score you can achieve after performing the operation exactly k times.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 3
Output: 18
Explanation: We need to choose exactly 3 elements from nums to maximize the sum.
For the first iteration, we choose 5. Then sum is 5 and nums = [1,2,3,4,6]
For the second iteration, we choose 6. Then sum is 5 + 6 and nums = [1,2,3,4,7]
For the third iteration, we choose 7. Then sum is 5 + 6 + 7 = 18 and nums = [1,2,3,4,8]
So, we will return 18.
It can be proven, that 18 is the maximum answer that we can achieve.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [5,5,5], k = 2
Output: 11
Explanation: We need to choose exactly 2 elements from nums to maximize the sum.
For the first iteration, we choose 5. Then sum is 5 and nums = [5,5,6]
For the second iteration, we choose 6. Then sum is 5 + 6 = 11 and nums = [5,5,7]
So, we will return 11.
It can be proven, that 11 is the maximum answer that we can achieve.
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 100
1 <= nums[i] <= 100
1 <= k <= 100

```js
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @param {number} k
 * @return {number}
 */
var maximizeSum = function(nums, k) {
    // Find the maximum value in the array 'nums'
    let max = Math.max(...nums);

    // Initialize a variable 'sum' to track the cumulative sum
    let sum = 0;
    
    // Iterate 'k' times to choose the maximum value and add it to the sum
    for(let i = 0; i < k; i++){
        sum += max;
        // Increment the maximum value for the next iteration
        max += 1;
    }

    // Return the final sum
    return sum;
};
```

The time complexity of the function is O(n), where n is the length of the array 'nums'. The function iterates through the array once to find the maximum value, and the subsequent loop runs 'k' times, resulting in a linear time complexity.
