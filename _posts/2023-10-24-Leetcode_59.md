A pangram is a sentence where every letter of the English alphabet appears at least once.

Given a string sentence containing only lowercase English letters, return true if sentence is a pangram, or false otherwise.

Example 1:

Input: sentence = "thequickbrownfoxjumpsoverthelazydog"
Output: true
Explanation: sentence contains at least one of every letter of the English alphabet.
Example 2:

Input: sentence = "leetcode"
Output: false

```js
/**
 * @param {string} sentence
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var checkIfPangram = function (sentence) {
  // Use set to store the unique characters without duplication
  let set = new Set(sentence);

  // If set size is not equal to 26, return false
  if (set.size !== 26) {
    return false;
  } else {
    // If set siez is equal to 26, return true
    return true;
  }
};
```

Create a `Set` is used to store the unique characters from the `sentence`. Check size of the `set` using `set.size`. If the size is not equal to 26, you return `false`. This is because for a sentence to be a pangram, it should contain all 26 letters of the English alphabet, and if the size of the set is not 26, it means some letters are missing. If the size of the `set` is 26, you return `true`, indicating that the sentence is a pangram.

The time complexity of the code is O(n), where `n` is the length of the input `sentence`, because it iterates through the characters in the sentence to build the set.
