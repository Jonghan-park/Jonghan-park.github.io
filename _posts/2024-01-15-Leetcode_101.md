You are given two lists of closed intervals, firstList and secondList, where firstList[i] = [starti, endi] and secondList[j] = [startj, endj]. Each list of intervals is pairwise disjoint and in sorted order.

Return the intersection of these two interval lists.

A closed interval [a, b] (with a <= b) denotes the set of real numbers x with a <= x <= b.

The intersection of two closed intervals is a set of real numbers that are either empty or represented as a closed interval. For example, the intersection of [1, 3] and [2, 4] is [2, 3].

Example 1:
![Alt text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/01/30/interval1.png)
Input: firstList = [[0,2],[5,10],[13,23],[24,25]], secondList = [[1,5],[8,12],[15,24],[25,26]]
Output: [[1,2],[5,5],[8,10],[15,23],[24,24],[25,25]]

Example 2:

Input: firstList = [[1,3],[5,9]], secondList = []
Output: []

Constraints:

0 <= firstList.length, secondList.length <= 1000
firstList.length + secondList.length >= 1
0 <= starti < endi <= 109
endi < starti+1
0 <= startj < endj <= 109
endj < startj+1

```js
/**
 * @param {number[][]} firstList
 * @param {number[][]} secondList
 * @return {number[][]}
 */
var intervalIntersection = function (firstList, secondList) {
  // Initialize an empty array to store the result of interval intersections
  let result = [];
  // Initialize pointers for the two lists
  let firstP = 0;
  let secondP = 0;

  // Iterate through both lists until one of them is exhausted
  while (firstP < firstList.length && secondP < secondList.length) {
    // Determine the maximum starting point and minimum ending point of the current pair of intervals
    let maxNum = Math.max(firstList[firstP][0], secondList[secondP][0]);
    let minNum = Math.min(firstList[firstP][1], secondList[secondP][1]);

    // Check if there is an intersection between the intervals (maxNum <= minNum)
    if (maxNum <= minNum) {
      // If there is an intersection, add the interval [maxNum, minNum] to the result
      result.push([maxNum, minNum]);
    }

    // Move the pointer of the list with the smaller ending point to the next interval
    firstList[firstP][1] < secondList[secondP][1] ? firstP++ : secondP++;
  }

  // Return the result containing interval intersections
  return result;
};
```

The time complexity of this solution is O(n + m), where n is the length of the firstList and m is the length of the secondList. This is because we iterate through both lists once.

The space complexity is O(1) because we are using a constant amount of extra space to store the result array.
