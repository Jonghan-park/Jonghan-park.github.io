There is a programming language with only four operations and one variable X:

++X and X++ increments the value of the variable X by 1.
--X and X-- decrements the value of the variable X by 1.
Initially, the value of X is 0.

Given an array of strings operations containing a list of operations, return the final value of X after performing all the operations.

Example 1:

Input: operations = ["--X","X++","X++"]
Output: 1
Explanation: The operations are performed as follows:
Initially, X = 0.
--X: X is decremented by 1, X = 0 - 1 = -1.
X++: X is incremented by 1, X = -1 + 1 = 0.
X++: X is incremented by 1, X = 0 + 1 = 1.
Example 2:

Input: operations = ["++X","++X","X++"]
Output: 3
Explanation: The operations are performed as follows:
Initially, X = 0.
++X: X is incremented by 1, X = 0 + 1 = 1.
++X: X is incremented by 1, X = 1 + 1 = 2.
X++: X is incremented by 1, X = 2 + 1 = 3.
Example 3:

Input: operations = ["X++","++X","--X","X--"]
Output: 0
Explanation: The operations are performed as follows:
Initially, X = 0.
X++: X is incremented by 1, X = 0 + 1 = 1.
++X: X is incremented by 1, X = 1 + 1 = 2.
--X: X is decremented by 1, X = 2 - 1 = 1.
X--: X is decremented by 1, X = 1 - 1 = 0.

```js
/**
 * @param {string[]} operations
 * @return {number}
 */
var finalValueAfterOperations = function (operations) {
  let result = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < operations.length; i++) {
    if (operations[i] === "--X" || operations[i] === "X--") {
      result--;
    } else {
      result++;
    }
  }

  return result;
};
```

`let result = 0;`: Initialize a variable `result` to 0. This variable will store the final value after performing all the operations.

`for(let i = 0; i < operations.length; i++) {`: Start a loop that iterates over the elements of the `operations` array.

`if(operations[i] === "--X" || operations[i] === "X--") {`: Check if the current element is either `"--X"` or `"X--"`.

`result--;`: If the current element is `"--X"` or `"X--"`, decrement the `result` variable by 1.

`} else {`: If the current element is not `"--X"` or `"X--"`.

`result++;`: Increment the `result` variable by 1.

`return result;`: Return the final value stored in the `result` variable after the loop finishes.
