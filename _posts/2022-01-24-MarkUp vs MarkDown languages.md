# Markdown language
 >Markdown is a type of markup language that aims for document forms that are easy to read, unlike HTML documents covered with all kinds of tags.

 Markdown = a **lightweight** markup language.

 Since it aims for a document style that is easy to read and write, the complex tag structure disappears and allows you to write by knowing simple texts and a few grammar.
