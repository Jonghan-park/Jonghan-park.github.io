You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

Return the merged string.

Example 1:

Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"
Output: "apbqcr"
Explanation: The merged string will be merged as so:
word1:  a   b   c
word2:    p   q   r
merged: a p b q c r
Example 2:

Input: word1 = "ab", word2 = "pqrs"
Output: "apbqrs"
Explanation: Notice that as word2 is longer, "rs" is appended to the end.
word1:  a   b 
word2:    p   q   r   s
merged: a p b q   r   s
Example 3:

Input: word1 = "abcd", word2 = "pq"
Output: "apbqcd"
Explanation: Notice that as word1 is longer, "cd" is appended to the end.
word1:  a   b   c   d
word2:    p   q 
merged: a p b q c   d

```js
/**
 * @param {string} word1
 * @param {string} word2
 * @return {string}
 */
var mergeAlternately = function(word1, word2) {
    const merged = [];
  const len1 = word1.length;
  const len2 = word2.length;
  const maxLength = Math.max(len1, len2);

  for (let i = 0; i < maxLength; i++) {
    if (i < len1) {
      merged.push(word1[i]);
    }
    if (i < len2) {
      merged.push(word2[i]);
    }
  }

  return merged.join('');
};
```

The function initializes an empty array `merged` to store the merged string and calculates the lengths of `word1` and `word2`.

The `maxLength` variable is set to the maximum of the lengths of `word1` and `word2`, which determines the number of iterations needed in the loop.

The loop runs for `maxLength` iterations, and in each iteration, it checks if the current index `i` is within the bounds of `word1` and `word2`. If so, it adds the character at index `i` from the corresponding word to the `merged` array.
