Given an integer num, return the number of steps to reduce it to zero.

In one step, if the current number is even, you have to divide it by 2, otherwise, you have to subtract 1 from it.

Example 1:

Input: num = 14
Output: 6
Explanation:
Step 1) 14 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 7.
Step 2) 7 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 6.
Step 3) 6 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 3.
Step 4) 3 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 2.
Step 5) 2 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 1.
Step 6) 1 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 0.
Example 2:

Input: num = 8
Output: 4
Explanation:
Step 1) 8 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 4.
Step 2) 4 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 2.
Step 3) 2 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 1.
Step 4) 1 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 0.
Example 3:

Input: num = 123
Output: 12

```js
/**
 * @param {number} num
 * @return {number}
 */
var numberOfSteps = function (num) {
  let count = 0;

  while (num !== 0) {
    if (num % 2 === 0) {
      num = num / 2;
      count++;
    }
    if (num % 2 === 1) {
      num--;
      count++;
    }
  }
  return count;
};
```

The function `numberOfSteps` takes a non-negative integer `num` as input and returns the number of steps required to reduce it to zero. The code enters a `while` loop that continues until `num` becomes zero. There are two conditional statements. The first one checks if `num` is even, and if it's even, `num` is divided by 2, and `count` is incremented by 1. The second conditional statement checks if `num` is odd, and if it's odd, `num` is decremented by 1, and `count` is incremented by 1. Ultimately, `num` will be zero and loop will be terminated, so `count` has number of iterates value.

Time complexity : O(log n)
Space complexity : O(1)
