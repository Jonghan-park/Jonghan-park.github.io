Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
Example 3:

Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]

```js
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @param {number} target
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var twoSum = function (nums, target) {
  let result = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    for (let j = i + 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
      if (nums[i] + nums[j] === target) {
        return (result = [i, j]);
      }
    }
  }
};
```

A result array (`result`) is initialized to store the indices of the two numbers that sum up to the target.
Two nested loops iterate over the `nums` array:
The outer loop iterates through each element of the array.
The inner loop iterates through the remaining elements after the current element of the outer loop.
For each pair of elements at indices `i` and `j`, the code checks if their sum equals the target.
If the sum condition is met, the indices `i` and `j` are stored in the `result` array, and the function immediately returns this array.
