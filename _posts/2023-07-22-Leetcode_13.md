Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

Example 1:

Input: haystack = "sadbutsad", needle = "sad"
Output: 0
Explanation: "sad" occurs at index 0 and 6.
The first occurrence is at index 0, so we return 0.
Example 2:

Input: haystack = "leetcode", needle = "leeto"
Output: -1
Explanation: "leeto" did not occur in "leetcode", so we return -1.

```js
/**
 * @param {string} haystack
 * @param {string} needle
 * @return {number}
 */
var strStr = function (haystack, needle) {
  return haystack.indexOf(needle);
};
```

Inside the function, it uses the `indexOf()` method on the `haystack` string to search for the first occurrence of the `needle` string. The `indexOf()` method returns the starting index of the first occurrence of the `needle` in the `haystack`. If the `needle` is not found, it returns `-1`.
