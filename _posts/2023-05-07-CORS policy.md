# The problem I had while developing - Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

## I had a problem that I couldn't get weather data from openweather api. Several days ago, I got an error about CORS policy

## CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing) allows web pages to make requests to APIs or resources hosted on different domains. Without CORS, web pages are limited to only making requests to resources hosted on the same domain as the web page itself, which is known as the same-origin policy.
