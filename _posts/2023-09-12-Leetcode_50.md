Given two arrays of integers nums and index. Your task is to create target array under the following rules:

Initially target array is empty.
From left to right read nums[i] and index[i], insert at index index[i] the value nums[i] in target array.
Repeat the previous step until there are no elements to read in nums and index.
Return the target array.

It is guaranteed that the insertion operations will be valid.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [0,1,2,3,4], index = [0,1,2,2,1]
Output: [0,4,1,3,2]
Explanation:
nums index target
0 0 [0]
1 1 [0,1]
2 2 [0,1,2]
3 2 [0,1,3,2]
4 1 [0,4,1,3,2]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,0], index = [0,1,2,3,0]
Output: [0,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
nums index target
1 0 [1]
2 1 [1,2]
3 2 [1,2,3]
4 3 [1,2,3,4]
0 0 [0,1,2,3,4]
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1], index = [0]
Output: [1]

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length, index.length <= 100
nums.length == index.length
0 <= nums[i] <= 100
0 <= index[i] <= i

```js
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @param {number[]} index
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var createTargetArray = function (nums, index) {
  let arr = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    arr.splice(index[i], 0, nums[i]);
  }
  return arr;
};
```

The JavaScript function `createTargetArray` takes two arrays, `nums` and `index`, as input. It aims to create a new array `arr` by inserting elements from `nums` at specified positions determined by the corresponding values in the `index` array. It does so by iterating through `nums`, and for each element, it uses the `splice` method to insert it at the specified index in the `arr` array. After processing all elements, it returns the resulting `arr`. Essentially, this function constructs a target array based on the values in `nums` and their insertion positions defined in the `index` array.
