Table: DailySales

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+---------+
| date_id | date |
| make_name | varchar |
| lead_id | int |
| partner_id | int |
+-------------+---------+
There is no primary key (column with unique values) for this table. It may contain duplicates.
This table contains the date and the name of the product sold and the IDs of the lead and partner it was sold to.
The name consists of only lowercase English letters.

For each date_id and make_name, find the number of distinct lead_id's and distinct partner_id's.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

Example 1:

Input:
DailySales table:
+-----------+-----------+---------+------------+
| date_id | make_name | lead_id | partner_id |
+-----------+-----------+---------+------------+
| 2020-12-8 | toyota | 0 | 1 |
| 2020-12-8 | toyota | 1 | 0 |
| 2020-12-8 | toyota | 1 | 2 |
| 2020-12-7 | toyota | 0 | 2 |
| 2020-12-7 | toyota | 0 | 1 |
| 2020-12-8 | honda | 1 | 2 |
| 2020-12-8 | honda | 2 | 1 |
| 2020-12-7 | honda | 0 | 1 |
| 2020-12-7 | honda | 1 | 2 |
| 2020-12-7 | honda | 2 | 1 |
+-----------+-----------+---------+------------+
Output:
+-----------+-----------+--------------+-----------------+
| date_id | make_name | unique_leads | unique_partners |
+-----------+-----------+--------------+-----------------+
| 2020-12-8 | toyota | 2 | 3 |
| 2020-12-7 | toyota | 1 | 2 |
| 2020-12-8 | honda | 2 | 2 |
| 2020-12-7 | honda | 3 | 2 |
+-----------+-----------+--------------+-----------------+
Explanation:
For 2020-12-8, toyota gets leads = [0, 1] and partners = [0, 1, 2] while honda gets leads = [1, 2] and partners = [1, 2].
For 2020-12-7, toyota gets leads = [0] and partners = [1, 2] while honda gets leads = [0, 1, 2] and partners = [1, 2].

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT date_id, make_name, COUNT(distinct lead_id) AS "unique_leads", COUNT(distinct partner_id) AS "unique_partners" FROM DailySales GROUP BY date_id, make_name;
```

`SELECT`: This clause specifies the columns to be included in the result set. Here, we are selecting the `date_id`, `make_name`, and two calculated columns for unique leads and unique partners.

`COUNT(DISTINCT lead_id) AS "unique_leads"`: This calculates the count of distinct `lead_id` values for each combination of `date_id` and `make_name`. The result is labeled as `"unique_leads"`.

`COUNT(DISTINCT partner_id) AS "unique_partners"`: This calculates the count of distinct `partner_id` values for each combination of `date_id` and `make_name`. The result is labeled as `"unique_partners"`.

`FROM DailySales`: Specifies the table from which data is being retrieved, in this case, the `DailySales` table.

`GROUP BY date_id, make_name`: This clause groups the data by the `date_id` and `make_name` columns. The `COUNT` functions then calculate the counts of unique leads and unique partners within each group.
