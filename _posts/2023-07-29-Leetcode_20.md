Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.

Example 1:

Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
Example 2:

Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
Example 3:

Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

```js
/**
 * @param {number} x
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var isPalindrome = function (x) {
  let nums = x.toString();

  return nums === nums.split("").reverse().join("");
};
```

The `x` integer is converted to a string using the `.toString()` method, and the resulting string is stored in the nums variable.

The `nums` string is split into an array of individual characters using `.split("")`. The `reverse()` method is then used to reverse the order of elements in the array.

The reversed array of characters is joined back into a string using `.join('')`

The function returns `true` if the original `nums` string is equal to the `nums`, which means the integer `x` is a palindrome. If they are not equal, it returns `false`, indicating that `x` is not a palindrome.
