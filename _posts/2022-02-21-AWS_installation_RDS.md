# What is RDS?

> Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. It provides cost-efficient and resizable capacity while automating time-consuming administration tasks, such as hardware provisioning, database setup, patching, and backups. It frees you to focus on your applications so you can give them the fast performance, high availability, security, and compatibility they need.

# What does RDS have features?  

- RDS does not have control over resources and OS, but it is convenient to receive a database immediately.
- Multi-az configuration is easy.
- Backup management is automated.
- You can decide whether to release it on the Internet or not.
- etc.

# Security configuration
- This section will be filled in when I completed figuring out how to create EC2 and connect with RDS and EC2.
